# Coffee Roasting Curve Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a neural network model for inline time-series prediction of the coffee roasting curve, laying the foundation for an automated coffee roasting tool. The goal is to move beyond the conventional PID control, which only minimizes the difference from a set value, toward a system that simulates the decision-making process of a skilled human operator.

Project Overview
By predicting the coffee roasting curve the model will enable more precise control of burner output, targeting an optimal roast profile. This approach considers nuanced roasting parameters, aiming for a high-quality roast.





Objectives
Accurate Prediction of Roasting Curve
Generate a reliable prediction of the coffee roasting curve to anticipate the roast progression.


Enhanced Control Strategy
Build upon the prediction model to control burner settings dynamically, optimizing for the ideal roast profile and avoiding the reactive limitations of PID controllers.

Automated Roast Quality
Achieve a consistently high-quality roast by emulating expert decision-making based on the curve prediction.

Future Steps
Burner Control Model: Implement a model that utilizes the curve prediction to adjust burner output and achieve specified roast goals.
Refinement of Prediction Model: Fine-tune the model's predictive capabilities with additional roasting data for improved accuracy and adaptability to different machines.
